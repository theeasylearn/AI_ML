# Slide 21: 3D Array

- A **3D array** in NumPy is essentially an array of **2D arrays**â€”like a cube of numbers. It's also called a **tensor** with 3 axes:
  - **Axis 0**: Depth (number of 2D arrays)
  - **Axis 1**: Rows
  - **Axis 2**: Columns
- You can think of it like stacking multiple 2D matrices on top of each other.
- **Uses of 3D Arrays**:
  1. Image processing (color channels: RGB)
  2. Scientific simulations
  3. Deep learning (multi-dimensional data)
  4. Time-series over 2D grids
