# Slide 11: 2D Array

- A **2D array** in NumPy is a two-dimensional data structure.
- One should visualize it as a **grid or matrix** with rows and columns.
- It is used to represent **tabular data**, **images**, or **mathematical matrices**.
- Each element in a 2D array can be accessed using **two indices**: one for the row and one for the column.
- Like all NumPy arrays, 2D arrays are **memory-efficient** and support **vectorized operations**.
- **Where it is used?**
  - Commonly used in **data science**, **machine learning**, and **scientific computing** for tasks like matrix operations, image processing, or storing datasets.
