# Slide 2: Introduction to NumPy

- **NumPy** is a powerful Python library used for performing large-scale mathematical and scientific computations efficiently, quickly, and flexibly.
- It is considered indispensable in fields such as **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Scientific Computing** due to its performance and versatility.
- NumPy provides data structures—most notably the **ndarray** (n-dimensional array)—which are similar to Python lists but far more efficient in terms of memory usage and computational speed.
- **n-dimensional array** arrays enable fast and vectorized operations, making complex numerical tasks straightforward and optimized.
- By using NumPy, we can store and manipulate data in a way that is less resource-intensive compared to native Python structures. It also supports various mathematical functions, linear algebra operations, and tools for integrating with other scientific libraries.
