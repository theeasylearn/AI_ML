# Slide 8: Key Differences Between List and NumPy Array

| **Feature**                | **Python List**                              | **NumPy Array**                              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Data Type**              | Can hold mixed types (int, float, str)       | Must have the same data type (int, float, etc.) |
| **Performance**            | Slower (due to dynamic typing)               | Faster (optimized for numerical operations)  |
| **Memory Usage**           | Takes more memory                            | Uses less memory (efficient storage)         |
| **Mathematical Operations**| Need explicit loops (e.g., for loop)          | Supports vectorized operations (faster calculations) |
| **Built-in Methods**       | General-purpose functions (append(), sort(), etc.) | Specialized functions for math, stats, and linear algebra |
| **Multi-Dimensional Support** | Only 1D (nested lists for more)             | Supports multi-dimensional arrays (e.g., 2D, 3D) |
| **Flexibility**            | More flexible, stores mixed data types       | Optimized for numerical computing            |
