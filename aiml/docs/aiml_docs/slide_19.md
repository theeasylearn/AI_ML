# Slide 19: Key Differences Between arange and linspace

- Both `np.arange()` and `np.linspace()` are NumPy functions used to generate numerical sequences, but they have some differences in their behavior.
- **`arange()`**:
  - Generates a sequence of values from **start** to **stop** with a given **step size**.
  - Excludes **stop** value.
- **`linspace()`**:
  - Generates a sequence of **num** evenly spaced values from **start** to **stop**.
  - Includes **stop** value unless specified otherwise by `endpoint=False`.
